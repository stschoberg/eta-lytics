I have been almost every chair that I have wanted to be besides brotherhood. I think brotherhood should become as important as social and rush. This semester was a good semester but to make next semester great will require there to be a lot of brotherhood events. The reason why it is so important to me is that most of the events that I remember in my time in Psk are the brotherhood events (besides registers and away weekends). I couldn‚Äôt tell you about a single social because they all blur together, but Zac Brown tailgate, casino trip, paintball, etc are the events that I really remember. So I encourage the brotherhood chairs to really make an effort to plan some good events next semester, not everything we do together has to be drinking.","system":false,"attachments":[],"favorited_by":["13295549","16803148","17685147","19492566","19833700","21881903","22047534","23761371","24280778","24542244","25256593","26126018","26421292","27592950","27676046","27681987","27721861","27992022","29049186","29875098","31306657","35680758","36089908","36574238","36689278","36939085","38590749","39092107","39143919","39381151","39488493","40611262","41142739","41172134","41715154","42256812","42263275","45026812","47135793","49603263","50010947","61277728","63137466","63338936"],"sender_type":"user","sender_id":"28739547"},{"id":"157661508295210910","source_guid":"8DBD6C7D-1F69-42BD-8C8E-D7B305C6FBB8","created_at":1576615082,"user_id":"28739547","group_id":"49426754","name":"ü§†","avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/1024x1024.jpeg.9a9d0c58b46e4f7c91ec86f37f7555f9","text":"Alright fellas the time has come that I have been dreading where I have to leave eta.
